<h2 id='decoupled-authentication'>Decoupled Authentication</h2>
<p>Where Redirect to App is unable to be used for the purposes of CDR authentication:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data recipients <strong>MAY</strong> provide decoupled consent experiences that facilitate separation of the Consumption Device from the authorisation flow.</li>
<li>Data holders <strong>MAY</strong> provide decoupled authorisation experiences that facilitate separation of the Consumption Device from the Authentication Device. </li>
</ul>

<p>If implemented, data holders and data recipients <strong>MUST</strong> support decoupled authentication in accordance with any relevant <a href="#consumer-experience_authentication-standards">consumer experience authentication</a> and <a href="#security-profile">security profile</a> standards.</p>
