<strong>Disclosure Consent: Insight Descriptions</strong>

<strong>Note:</strong> The use of the term ‘data recipients’ to refer to accredited data recipients is consistent with the data standards nomenclature. Where these standards refer to ‘data recipient’, this should not be taken to mean a non-accredited person or trusted adviser.</p>
