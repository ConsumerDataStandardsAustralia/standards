<td><strong>Consent:</strong><br/>Amendment of Collection Consents and Authorisations</td>
<td>When notifying a Data Holder of an amended collection consent as per rules 4.18C or 4.20S, Data Recipients <strong>MUST</strong> supply the relevant CDR Arrangement ID to the Data Holder according to <a href="#specifying-an-existing-arrangement">Specifying an existing arrangement</a>. Providing the CDR Arrangement ID is necessary to trigger the Data Holder authorisation flow simplifications outlined in the <a href="#amending-authorisation-standards">Amending Authorisation Standards</a>. Failure to supply the CDR Arrangement ID will result in the full authorisation flow and a disconnected data sharing arrangement history on consumer dashboards.</td>

<p>The standards in this section outline insight description requirements that apply where an insight disclosure consent is being sought and may also feature in CDR Receipts and Dashboards. These standards do not alter any existing rules obligations for CDR receipts or dashboards.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The use of the term ‘data recipients’ to refer to accredited data recipients is consistent with the data standards nomenclature. Where these standards refer to ‘data recipient’, this should not be taken to mean a non-accredited person or trusted adviser.</p>
