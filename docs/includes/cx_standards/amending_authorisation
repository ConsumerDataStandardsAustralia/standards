<td>Customer Profile</td>
<td>Where customer profile selection applies, Data Holders <strong>SHOULD</strong> omit the profile selection step and assume the customer profile associated with the existing authorisation. Data Holders <strong>MAY</strong> indicate which profile the authorisation relates to during the authorisation process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account Selection</td>
<td>Where account selection applies, Data Holders <strong>MUST</strong> pre-select accounts that were associated with the previous authorisation provided these accounts remain eligible and available to share. Data Holders <strong>MAY</strong> allow these accounts to be amended, and <strong>MAY</strong> provide information regarding the pre-selection of accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changing Attributes</td>
<td>Data Holders <strong>MUST</strong> indicate where a dataset is being added to an authorisation or a disclosure duration is being amended. Data Holders <strong>MAY</strong> apply this standard to other changing attributes, but this <strong>MUST ONLY</strong> apply where the attribute in the new authorisation differs to that of the previous authorisation. How a changed attributed is signified is at the Data Holderâ€™s discretion.</td>
