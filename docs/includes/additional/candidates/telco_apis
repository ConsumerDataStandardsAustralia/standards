<p>This specification defines the APIs for Data Holders exposing Telecommunications endpoints.</p>

<aside class="notice">
Note that the standards for the telecommunications sector are currently in candidate status and are not binding.

Candidate status means that these standards are not binding but they are stable.  These standards will only change by a formal decision of the Data Standards Chair following a consultation conforming to the CDR rules.
