<pre class="highlight diff tab-diff"><code>Updated Banking endpoint versions affected by the addition of the `BUY_NOW_PAY_LATER` value in the `product-category` query.

Added `instalments` object in 'Get Product Detail' and 'Get Account Detail' endpoints.

Added `EXTRA_DOWN_PAYMENT` `featureType` to support 'Buy Now, Pay Later' or similar products where a variable down-payment may be made.

Added the 'Product Categories' section to include a general description of the `BUY_NOW_PAY_LATER` category.

Added the 'Product &amp; Account Components' section to include descriptions of the previously included `PAYMENT_LATE` and `UPFRONT_PER_PLAN` `feeType` values.

The endpoint versions incremented due to these changes are:
 - Get Accounts (v3)
 - Get Bulk Balances (v2)
 - Get Account Detail (v4)
 - Get Bulk Direct Debits (v2)
 - Get Scheduled Payments Bulk (v3)

Previous Banking endpoint versions are available through the respective 'Obsolete versions' links.

Corrected minor typos and updated documentation formatting.
