<h1 id='additional-standards'>Additional Standards</h1>
<p>The Consumer Data Standards also incorporate other non-binding standards that are developed to facilitate consultation and feedback or to facilitate voluntary extension of CDR implementations.</p>

<p>These standards fall into three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Candidate</code> standards that are non-binding and stable</li>
<li><code>Draft</code> standards that are non-binding but volatile as they are under development</li>
<li><code>Experimental</code> standards that are transient and created to test concepts</li>
</ol>
<h2 id='candidate-standards'>Candidate Standards</h2>
<p>The Consumer Data Standards currently include the following Candidate Standards:</p>

<ul>
