        Some general notes that apply to all endpoints that retrieve transactions:<ul><li>Where multiple transactions are returned, transactions should be ordered according to effective date in descending order<li>As the date and time for a transaction can alter depending on status and transaction type two separate date/times are included in the payload. There are still some scenarios where neither of these time stamps is available. For the purpose of filtering and ordering it is expected that the data holder will use the "effective" date/time which will be defined as:<ul><li>Posted date/time if available, then<li>Execution date/time if available, then<li>A reasonable date/time nominated by the data holder using internal data structures</ul><li>For transaction amounts it should be assumed that a negative value indicates a reduction of the available balance on the account while a positive value indicates an increase in the available balance on the account<li>For aggregated transactions (i.e. groups of sub transactions reported as a single entry for the account) only the aggregated information, with as much consistent information across the subsidiary transactions as possible, is required to be shared.</ul>

        Obtain a list of products that are currently openly offered to the market.

        Note that the results returned by this endpoint are expected to be ordered in descending order according to _lastUpdated_.

        ### Conventions
        In the product reference payloads there are a number of recurring conventions that are explained below.

        #### Arrays Of Features

        In the product detail payload there are a number of arrays articulating generic features, constraints, prices, etc. The intent of these arrays is as follows:

        - Each element in an array has the same structure so that clients can reliably interpret the payloads
        - Each element as a type element that is an enumeration of the specific aspect of a product being described, such as types of fees.
        - Each element has a field named [_additionalValue_](#productfeaturetypedoc). This is a generic field with contents that will vary based on the type of object being described. The contents of this field for the `ADDITIONAL_CARDS` feature is the number of cards allowed while the contents of this field for the `MAX_LIMIT` constraint would be the maximum credit limit allowed for the product.
        - An element in these arrays of the same type may appear more than once. For instance, a product may offer two separate loyalty programs that the customer can select from. A fixed term mortgage may have different rates for different term lengths.
        - An element in these arrays may contain an _additionalInfo_ and _additionalInfoUri_ field. The _additionalInfo_ field is used to provide displayable text clarifying the purpose of the element in some way when the product is presented to a customer. The _additionalInfoUri_ provides a link to externally hosted information specifically relevant to that feature of the product.
        - Depending on the type of data being represented there may be additional specific fields.

        #### URIs To More Information

        As the complexities and nuances of a financial product can not easily be fully expressed in a data structure without a high degree of complexity it is necessary to provide additional reference information that a potential customer can access so that they are fully informed of the features and implications of the product. The payloads for product reference therefore contain numerous fields that are provided to allow the product holder to describe the product more fully using a web page hosted on their online channels.

        These URIs do not need to all link to different pages. If desired, they can all link to a single hosted page and use different HTML anchors to focus on a specific topic such as eligibility or fees.

        #### Linkage To Accounts
        From the moment that a customer applies for a product and an account is created the account and the product that spawned it will diverge. Rates and features of the product may change and a discount may be negotiated for the account.

        For this reason, while _productCategory_ is a common field between accounts and products, there is no specific ID that can be used to link an account to a product within the regime.

        Similarly, many of the fields and objects in the product payload will appear in the account detail payload but the structures and semantics are not identical as one refers to a product that can potentially be originated and one refers to an account that actually has been instantiated and created along with the associated decisions inherent in that process.

        #### Dates
        It is expected that data consumers needing this data will call relatively frequently to ensure the data they have is representative of the current offering from a bank. To minimise the volume and frequency of these calls the ability to set a _lastUpdated_ field with the date and time of the last update to this product is included. A call for a list of products can then be filtered to only return products that have been updated since the last time that data was obtained using the _updated-since_ query parameter.

        In addition, the concept of effective date and time has also been included. This allows for a product to be marked for obsolescence, or introduction, from a certain time without the need for an update to show that a product has been changed. The inclusion of these dates also removes the need to represent deleted products in the payload. Products that are no longer offered can be marked not effective for a few weeks before they are then removed from the product set as an option entirely.
