# Consumer Data Right Standards

This repository contains the binding API Standards and Information Security profile created in response to the [Consumer Data Right](https://treasury.gov.au/consumer-data-right "Treasury's Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation and the subsequent regulatory rules.  The purpose of the Consumer Data Right regime is to give Australians greater control over their data and is intended to apply sector by sector across the whole Australian economy.

These standards are maintained by the Data Standards Body (DSB), with the Data Standards Chair as the decision maker.  The Data Standards Body is part of the [Treasury](https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/treasury/data-standards-body "Data Standards Body"). The work of standards development is conducted in consultation with the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0 "ACCC's CDR webpage") as co-regulator of the Consumer Data Right, along with the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/about-the-consumer-data-right/ "OAIC CDR webpage").

## Contributing To The Standards

Consultation on the standards as they evolve is performed transparently with any interested contributor invited to participate in accordance with the rules of engagement described below.

There are a number of ways to contribute to these standards:

* **[Issues posted on this repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards/issues)** - The issues posted on this repository are used for formal consultation of specific decision proposals that are to be considered by the Data Standards Chair.  These decisions constitute significant changes to the standards and are raised as required.  These issues constitute an audit trail of the decisions taken by the Data Standards Chair.  As this is the case it is requested that contributors do not raise new issues and instead contribute comments to the issues created by the DSB.

* **[The standards maintenance repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance)** - This repository is used to manage minor changes to established aspects of the standards.  Contributors are encouraged to raise new issues in this repository that will then be prioritised for resolution in a series of multi-week iterations.  Outcomes of these iterations will then be submitted to the Data Standards Chair for approval on this repository as a decision.  The [Consumer Data Right Support Portal](https://cdr-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) is the preferred way to search for answers, raise questions and request clarification of the standards.

* **[Via Email](mailto:contact@consumerdatastandards.gov.au)** - If you would like to submit a confidential question or item of feedback, or if GitHub feels unfamiliar, the DSB welcome email correspondence related to the standards and the standards development process.
