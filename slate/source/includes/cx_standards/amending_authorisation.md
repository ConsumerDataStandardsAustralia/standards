## Amending Authorisation Standards
|Area|CX Standard|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|**Authorisation:**<br/>Amending consent | The following standards apply when a Data Holder invites a CDR consumer to amend a current authorisation as per rule 4.22A and the ADR has supplied a *cdr_arrangement_id*:|
|Customer Profile|Where customer profile selection applies, Data Holders **SHOULD** omit the profile selection step and assume the customer profile associated with the existing authorisation. Data Holders **MAY** indicate which profile the authorisation relates to during the authorisation process.|
|Account Selection|Where account selection applies, Data Holders **MUST** pre-select accounts that were associated with the previous authorisation provided these accounts remain eligible and available to share. Data Holders **MAY** allow these accounts to be amended, and **MAY** provide information regarding the pre-selection of accounts.|
|Changing Attributes| Data Holders **MUST** indicate where a dataset is being added to an authorisation or a disclosure duration is being amended. Data Holders **MAY** apply this standard to other changing attributes, but this **MUST ONLY** apply where the attribute in the new authorisation differs to that of the previous authorisation. How a changed attributed is signified is at the Data Holderâ€™s discretion.|
