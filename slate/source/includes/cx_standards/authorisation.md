## Authorisation Standards



|Area|CX Standard|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|**Authorisation:**<br/> Account selection |Data holders **MUST** allow the consumer to select which of their accounts to share data from if the data request includes account-specific data and if there are multiple accounts available. The Data holder **MAY** omit this step if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).|
|**Authorisation:**<br/> Account selection functionality |<p>Data holders **MAY** include additional functionality to support account discovery and selection where further navigation or interaction is required to view all accounts. This may, for example, include search, sort, filter, scroll, grouping, and pagination, or other controls in line with existing consumer experiences. Any such functionality **MUST NOT** introduce unwarranted friction.</p><p>**Note:** Unwarranted friction should have regard to CDR Rule 4.24 and is considered to include the addition of any requirements beyond normal data holder practices for an equivalent account selection process.</p>|
|**Authorisation:**<br/>Profile selection |<p>Data holders **MAY** add a 'profile selection' step or equivalent prior to the account selection step if a single identifier provides access to different customer accounts. For example, one customer ID may give access to business customer and individual customer accounts.</p><p>The 'profile selection' step **SHOULD** only be considered if it is an existing customer experience, and **SHOULD** be as minimal as possible to avoid introducing unwarranted friction (having regard to CDR Rule 4.24).</p>|
|**Authorisation:**<br/>Add or Switch Profiles |Where the authorisation flow is presented to the consumer in a data holder app, the data holder **MUST** provide the consumer with the ability to switch or add user profiles based on the profiles supported by that app.|
|**Authorisation:**<br>Account confirm|Data holders **MUST** show which accounts the data is being shared from prior to confirming authorisation if the data request includes account-specific data. The data holder **MAY** omit this information if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).|
|**Authorisation:**<br>Pending status|<p>Where an account requires further actions or approvals before data can be disclosed, data holders **MUST** indicate this to the user visually and **MUST** provide an explanation of what is required or expected.</p><p>This **MAY**, for example, be achieved with a visual icon to indicate that the account is 'pending'. This indication **MUST** be accompanied by an in-context explanation to describe what the status means. This explanation **SHOULD** include any required actions and any specified time frames.</p>|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Displaying accounts|<p>If certain accounts are unavailable to share, data holders **SHOULD** show these unavailable accounts in the account-selection step. </p><p>Data holders **SHOULD** communicate why these accounts cannot be selected, and this **SHOULD** be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.</p><p>Data holders **MAY** provide instructions on how to make these accounts available to share, and this **SHOULD** be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.</p><p>**Note:** Unavailable accounts are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data.</p>|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>No accounts can be shown|If unavailable accounts cannot be shown in the account selection step, data holders **MAY** display a generic explanation and instructions.|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Authorisation not permitted|If a successfully authenticated user cannot proceed to establish an authorisation in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data, data holders **MAY** provide the option of concluding the authorisation process.|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Request sharing rights|If a user does not have sharing rights for a particular account or set of accounts, data holders **MAY** invite the user to request sharing rights from the authorisation flow. The presentation of this mechanism **MUST NOT** introduce unwarranted friction as defined in rule 4.24 on restrictions.|
