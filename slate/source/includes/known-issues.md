There are certain aspects of the standards that are actively under review. These known issues are articulated in the following table.

Issue | Description
:---- | :----------
Inconsistencies in Telco Candidate Standards | <ul><li>The Get Telco Products endpoint schema references an array of _plans_, which should be _products_.</li><li>Transaction endpoints reference a _serviceIds_ (plural) property described as an 'Array list', but with a Type as 'string'.</li><li>Redundant _service_ object in Telco Usage list endpoints.</li><li>Redundant _balance_ object in Telco Balance list endpoints.</li><li>Telco Usage list endpoints should have pagination links.</li><li>Some mandatory fields are not specified with valid 'required' statements, and some are incorrectly specified with default values.</li></ul>
Non-Bank Lending Candidate Standards | The Candidate Standards were updated in v1.34.1 to align to Decisions affecting the Banking endpoints that they have been based on, as of v1.34.0. Further details are in the Version Delta comments of the Candidate Standards.
Certificate Management | The [Certificate Management](#certificate-management) section is under review, pending a change expected to impact participants on 1 October 2025.<br>For more information refer to issue [#695 - Digicert Certificate Trust Chain Migration](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues/695).

## Future improvements

The following improvements will be incorporated into future versions of the Standards.

### Standardise Register API Error Codes

Future versions of the CDR Register API error codes are to be aligned to the [Standards high-level error codes](#error-codes) as follows:

API | Updated Error Codes | New Error Codes
-- | -- | --
[Get Data Holder Brands](#cdr-register-api_get-data-holder-brands) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field | 404: <br>Invalid Industry
[Get Software Statement Assertion (SSA)](#cdr-register-api_get-software-statement-assertion-ssa) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field <br><br>403: <br>The ADR or the ADR's Software Product is not active <br><br>404: <br>Invalid Industry / Invalid Brand Id / Invalid Software Product Id |
[Get Data Holder Statuses](#cdr-register-api_get-data-holder-statuses) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field | 404: <br>Invalid Industry
[Get Software Products Statuses](#cdr-register-api_get-software-products-statuses) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field | 404: <br>Invalid Industry
[Get Data Recipients Statuses](#cdr-register-api_get-data-recipients-statuses) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field | 404: <br>Invalid Industry
[Get Data Recipients](#cdr-register-api_get-data-recipients) | 400: <br>Missing Required Header / Invalid Header / Invalid Version / Invalid Field | 404: <br>Invalid Industry

### Standardise Banking Scheduled Payments endpoint paths

Future versions of the Banking _Get Scheduled Payments_ endpoints below could be aligned to the convention of [Get Scheduled Payments for Account](#cdr-banking-api_get-scheduled-payments-for-account) and other Banking 'accounts' endpoints as follows:

API | Current path | Proposed path
-- | -- | --
[Get Scheduled Payments Bulk](#cdr-banking-api_get-scheduled-payments-bulk) | `/banking/payments/scheduled` | `/banking/accounts/payments/scheduled`
[Get Scheduled Payments For Specific Accounts](#cdr-banking-api_get-scheduled-payments-for-specific-accounts) | `/banking/payments/scheduled` | `/banking/accounts/payments/scheduled`

### Address inconsistency in the Metadata Update endpoint response

- The `200 OK` response for the [Metadata Update](#cdr-admin-api_metadata-update) endpoint is currently presented as an 'Inline' schema, rendering as a `null` example response, where the specification defines an empty object `{}`. 
- The [Response Payload Structure](#response-payload-structure) section states that `200 OK` responses **MUST** contain _data_ and _links_ objects. 
- As this endpoint is expected to trigger an asynchronous process, a `202 Accepted` response code and an alternate response body may address these inconsistencies.
