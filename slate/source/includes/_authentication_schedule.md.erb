# Authentication Schedule

```diff
Added new Authentication Schedule section with the following sub-sections:
+ Redirect to App
+ Decoupled Authentication
+ Fallback Authentication Flows
```

This schedule outlines specific terms and approaches supported by the data standards for the purposes of a consumer authenticating themselves with a data holder.

**Definitions**

|Term|Meaning|
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
|**Authentication Provider** |A system entity that provides authentication of a Customer in order to access data or a service provided by that entity.|
|**Consumption Device**|The device the Customer uses to interact with the Data Recipient Software Product. This is the device that initiates the consent flow.|
|**Authentication Device**|The device the Customer uses for authentication and the authorisation grant.|
|**Authenticator**|Something the Customer possesses and controls that is used to authenticate the userâ€™s identity.|
|**Authentication Factor**|The three types of authentication factors are:<ul><li>something the Customer knows (like a password or PIN),</li><li>something the Customer has (like a registered device or security key),</li><li>something the Customer is (like their fingerprint or face biometric).</li></ul>|
|**Single Factor Authentication**| An authentication challenge where the Authentication Provider requires only one Authentication Factor for successful authentication.|
|**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**| An authentication challenge where the Authentication Provider requires two or more distinct types of Authentication Factors for successful authentication. MFA can be performed using a multi-factor authenticator or by combining single-factor authenticators that provide different types of factors.|
