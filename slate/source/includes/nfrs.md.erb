# Non-functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Consumer Data Right regime cover a number of considerations:

- Minimum performance and availability expectations for data holders.  Included to ensure a reliable and performant service is offered to Data Recipients and customers.
- Maximum traffic expectations for data holders.  Included to ensure there is a ceiling for the amount of traffic that a data holder is expected to service.
- Requirements for reporting of performance.  Included to provide transparency of performance without the need for time consuming auditing or inspection.
- Requirements for data latency and quality.  Included to give a clear indication to the depth and recency of the data available under the regime.
- Limitations on the number of calls that a Data Recipient Software Product can make to a single provider.  Included to protect data holders from poorly designed or overly transactional Data Recipient implementations.
