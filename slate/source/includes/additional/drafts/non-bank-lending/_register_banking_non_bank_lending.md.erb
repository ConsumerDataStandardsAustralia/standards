# Register APIs

The following section provides an overview of the Register APIs for Data Holders and Data Recipients to collect participant metadata.
These endpoints are exposed by the Register and consumed by Data Holders and Data Recipients.

<aside class="warning">
  These endpoints are not implemented by Data Holders and Data Recipients. They are hosted by the Register for consumption by participants.
  Data Holders and Data Recipient Software Products are required to call these endpoints to obtain metadata that enables connection and registration between participants as well as obtaining the status of participants in the CDR.
  These statuses are provided authoritatively by the Register to allow participants to determine whether a connecting third-party is permitted to perform registration requests or data sharing requests.

The endpoint versions incremented due to these changes are:
 - Get Data Holder Brands (v3)
 - Get Data Holder Brands Summary (v2)
 - Get Data Holder Statuses (v2).

Previous Register endpoint versions are available through the respective 'Obsolete versions' links.
