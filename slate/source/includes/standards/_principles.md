## Principles

The following principles, classified as Outcome Principles and Technical Principles, are the basis for the development of the standards for the Consumer Data Right.

### Outcome Principles
These principles articulate qualitative outcomes that the API definitions should seek to deliver.

#### Outcome Principle 1: APIs are secure
The API definitions will consider and incorporate the need for a high degree of security to protect customer data.  This includes the risk of technical breach but also additional concerns of inadvertent data leakage through overly broad data payloads and scopes.  The security of customer data is a first order outcome that the API standards must seek to deliver.

#### Outcome Principle 2: APIs use open standards
In order to promote widespread adoption, open standards that are robust and widely used in the industry will be used wherever possible.

#### Outcome Principle 3: Data sharing provides a positive consumer experience
The standards will ensure that CDR consumers have simple, informed, and trustworthy data
sharing experiences that provide them with positive outcomes over the short and long term.

#### Outcome Principle 4: APIs provide a good developer experience
To ensure that the entry hurdle for new developers is low the experience of the developers that are building clients using the APIs will be considered.  The ability for a developer to easily understand and write code using the APIs in modern development environments should be facilitated by the API standards.

#### Outcome Principle 5: Standards are consistent across sectors
The standards will strive for consistency in patterns, structure, security mechanisms and
user experience across sectors to facilitate the development of customer experiences and
services that are able to integrate data from multiple sectors seamlessly and to reduce the
cost of customer education for new sectors.

### Technical Principles
These principles articulate specific technical outcomes that the API definitions should seek to deliver.

#### Technical Principle 1: APIs are RESTful
The API standards will adhere to RESTful API concepts where possible and sensible to do so.  In particular the concepts of statelessness and resource orientation will be followed.

#### Technical Principle 2: APIs are implementation agnostic
The underlying implementation of the APIs should not be constrained or driven by the API definitions and standards.  Conversely, the underlying implementation choices should not be visible or derivable to the client applications using the APIs.

#### Technical Principle 3: APIs are simple
As complexity will increase implementation costs for both holders and clients as well as reduce the utility of the APIs, API definitions should seek to be as simple as possible but no simpler.

#### Technical Principle 4: APIs are rich in capability
As the APIs are defined care should be taken to ensure that the data payloads defined represent rich data sets that can be used in many scenarios, including scenarios not necessarily front of mind during the design process.

#### Technical Principle 5: APIs are performant
The API definitions should consider and incorporate performance implications during design ensuring that repeated calls are not necessary for simple use cases and that payload sizes do not introduce performance issues.

#### Technical Principle 6: APIs are consistent
The API definitions across the full suite of APIs should be consistent with each other as much as possible.  Where possible common data structures and patterns should be defined and reused.

#### Technical Principle 7: APIs are version controlled and backwards compatible
As the API definitions evolve care will be taken to ensure the operation of existing clients are protected when breaking changes occur.  Breaking changes will be protected by a well-defined version control model and by a policy of maintaining previous versions for a period of time to allow for backwards compatibility.

####Technical Principle 8: APIs are extensible
The API definitions and standards should be built for extensibility. This extensibility should accommodate future API categories and industry sectors but it should also allow for extension by data holders to create unique, value add offerings to the ecosystem.

###Consumer Experience Principles
These principles articulate qualitative outcomes for consumer experience that the standards should seek to deliver.

####CX Principle 1: The CDR is Consumer-centric
The CDR consumer experience is intuitive and is centred on consumer attitudes, needs,
behaviours, and expectations – noting that these may change over time.

####CX Principle 2: The CDR is Accessible and Inclusive
A diverse range of people are able to access, use, and comprehend the CDR ecosystem regardless of
their background, situation, experience, or personal characteristics.

####CX Principle 3: The CDR is Comprehensible
When interacting with the CDR, consumers are able to understand the following:

* ***who*** their data is shared with;
* ***what*** information is shared;
* ***when*** sharing begins and ceases;
* ***where*** data is shared to and from;
* ***why*** their data is being requested; and
* ***how*** they can manage and control the sharing and use of their data.

####CX Principle 4: The CDR is Simple and Empowering
Consumer interactions with the CDR are as simple as possible, but not at the expense of
informed consent, consumer control, transparency, privacy, or comprehension. Consumers
should be encouraged to be privacy conscious without experiencing cognitive loads that
lead to disengagement. Consumers should also be empowered by the CDR without
interactive burdens being placed on them.

####CX Principle 5: Consent is Current
Consent is granted at a point in time and is only as current as the consumer’s original intent.
Consumer attitudes and behaviours may change over time and be impacted by external
events such as the expansion of the CDR or consumer awareness. Consent terms should
always align to current consumer preferences.
