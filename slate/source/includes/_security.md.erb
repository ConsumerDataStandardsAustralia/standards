## CDR Federation
The CDR Federation will facilitate the secure exchange of consumer data and federation metadata between
multiple system entities which will assume one or more of the following roles:

-   **Data Holder**:
    -   Multiple Data Holders will be supported.
-   **Data Recipient**:
    -   Multiple Data Recipients will be supported.
- 	**Registry**:
    -   It is envisaged that only one registry will be supported and will be
        maintained by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).

### Data Holder
The Data Holder (DH) is a system entity that authenticates a consumer
(resource owner or user), as part of an authorisation process initiated by a Data
Recipient, and issues an authorisation for that Data Recipient to access the consumer's data via published APIs.

A Data Holder assumes the role of an **[OIDC]** [OpenID Provider](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Overview).

### Data Recipient
A Data Recipient (DR) is system entity that is authorised by a
Data Holder to access consumer resources (APIs). A Data Recipient MUST capture consumer consent prior to commencing an authorisation process with a Data Holder.

A Data Recipient MUST be accredited in order to participate in the CDR Federation.  Accreditation rules for Data Recipients are beyond the scope of this artifact.

A Data Recipient assumes the role of an **[OIDC]** [Relying Party (Client)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Overview).

### Registry
<aside class="warning">
NOTE: This section is reflective of the positioning of the Registry in the CDR Rules Exposure Draft
</aside>

The Registry is a central point of discovery for both Data Holders and Data
Recipients. Data Holders and Data Recipients must be created as entities in the Registry in order for them to participate as members of the CDR Federation.  The functionality of the Registry will include but will not be limited to:

- **Management of Identities and Access**: The Registry will allow registered persons, on behalf of Data Holders and Data Recipients, to manage the metadata of their associated organisations and systems.
- **Management of Certificates**: The Registry will facilitate the issuing, management and revocation of digital certificates.
- **Discoverability and Search**: The Registry will expose APIs and GUIs (Web applications) in order to support metadata queries across Registry entities.

## Authentication Flows
This profile supports the authentication flows specified by [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) [OIDC] as constrained further by [FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) **[FAPI]**.

Specifically the Hybrid Flow outlined at [section 3.3](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) of **[OIDC]**.

No other flows are currently supported.

<a id="hybrid-flow"></a>
### OIDC Hybrid Flow
The **[OIDC]** Hybrid Flow is a type of redirection flow where the consumers user
agent is redirected from a Data Recipient’s (Relying Party) web site to a Data
Holder’s Authorisation endpoint in the context of an **[OIDC]** authentication
request. The Hybrid flow incorporates aspects of the both the implicit flow and
authorisation code flow detailed under **[OIDC]**.

Only a `response_type` (see [section 3](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication) of **[OIDC]**) of `code id_token` SHALL be allowed.

The `request_uri` parameter SHALL NOT be supported.

<aside class="warning">
NOTE: This process of customer authentication and the customer experience of the subsequent process to obtain customer consent has been the subject of significant consultation and feedback.  To date, a consensus position has not been achieved to the satisfaction of the Data Standards Body.

As a result of this lack of consensus this decision does not contain additional specificity around the requirements for the authentication flow.  Additional specificity will be added to the profile once a position on the authentication flow has been reached.

The following specific options for the authentication flow have been identified:
<ol>
<li>Standard Redirect Flow: Username and password are captured in a redirected web page and consent is then obtained in the redirected web page.</li>
<li>Redirect With OTP Flow: Username is captured in a redirected page.  The Data Holder then provides a one-time password via another channel, which is then captured in the redirected page to authenticate the customer.  Consent is then obtained in that same web page.</li>
<li> Redirect With Known Channel: Username is captured in a redirected page.  Customer then proceeds to a known digital channel, authenticates and provides consent.</li>
<li>Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication: A decoupled and asynchronous authentication flow that is defined by FAPI.</li>
<li>CDR Specific Decoupled: A decoupled flow proposed by a community member where a one-time identifier is obtained from a known digital channel and then provided to the data recipient with consent being completed afterwards in an experience provided by the Data Holder.</li>
</ol>

Previously, a decision to pursue Redirect With Known Channel had been made by the Data Standards Body and a proposal for how this was to be implemented had been provided for consultation.  This proposal is not included in this decision.  CX testing of the flows described above is ongoing.
</aside>


<a id="client-authentication"></a>
## Client Authentication
Data Holder's MUST support the `private_key_jwt` Client Authentication method specified at [section 9](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) of **[OIDC]**.

The PKI Mutual TLS OAuth Client Authentication Method SHALL not be supported.  However as specified under [section 11.2](#mutual-tls), all back-channel communication between Data Recipient and Data Holder systems MUST incorporate, unless stated otherwise, MTLS as part of the TLS handshake.

### private\_key\_jwt

  "jti": "37747cd1-c105-4569-9f75-4adf28b73e31"
}
```

The `private_key_jwt` authentication method is enabled through the delivery of an encoded **[JWT]** signed using the Data Recipient's private key and thus facilitates non-repudiation. The **[JWT]** represents an assertion that MUST include the following claims:

- `iss`: The client ID of the bearer.
- `sub`: The client ID of the bearer.
- `aud`:  The URL of the endpoint being invoked.
- `exp`: A JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC expiry time.
- `jti`: A unique identifier generated by the client for this authentication.

The following claims MAY be included:

- `iat`: A JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC issued at time.

When invoking a protected endpoint, the aforementioned assertion MUST be sent with the `POST` method and MUST include the following parameters:

-  `grant_type`: This parameter MUST only be included when invoking the Token Endpoint and MUST be set to `authorisation_code` or `client_credentials`.
-  `code`: This parameter MUST only be included when invoking the Token Endpoint after utilising the [Hybrid Authentication flow](#hybrid-flow).  This is the value of the code parameter returned in the authorisation response.
-  `client_id`: The ID of the calling Client.
-  `client_assertion_type`: This MUST be set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.
-  `client_assertion`: The encoded assertion JWT.

## OIDC Client Types
Only Confidential Clients SHALL be supported under this profile. Therefore, Public clients SHALL NOT be supported.

## Tokens

}
```

ID Tokens are specified in [section 2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) of the **[OIDC]** standard.  In accordance with **[FAPI-RW]**, ID Tokens must be signed and encrypted when returned
to a Data Recipient from both the Authorisation
Endpoint and Token Endpoint.

As described under [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#authorization-server) of the **[FAPI-RW]** profile, ID Tokens MUST include the following claims (in addition to the mandatory claims specified in [section 2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) of the **[OIDC]** standard) as part of [Hybrid Flow authentication](#hybrid):

- `nonce`: String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token.
- `s_hash`: Hash of the state value.
- `c_hash`: Hash of the authorisation_code value.

ID Tokens MUST be signed by Data Holders as specified in [section 8.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#jws-algorithm-considerations) of **[FAPI-RW]**.

The ID Token returned from the Authorisation Endpoint MUST NOT contain any Personal Information (PI) claims.

An ID Token MUST not contain both a `vot` claim (see [Vectors of Trust](#vector-loas)) and an `acr` claim .

If the ID Token contains a `vot` claim, it MUST also contain a `vtm` claim:

- `vtm`: The trustmark URI as specified in [section 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-vectors-of-trust-15#section-5) of **[VOT]** .

#### Hashing value for state and authorisation code
The `c_hash` value MUST be generated according to [section 3.3.2.11](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridIDToken) of **[OIDC]**.

The `s_hash` value MUST be generated according to [section 5.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#introduction) of **[FAPI-RW]**.

### Access Token
Access Tokens MUST be used as specified in [section 10.3] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3) of **[OAUTH2]**. An
Access Token MUST expire `n` minutes after it is issued by the Data Holder where `n` is determined by **[CDR]** rules.

The process for refreshing an Access Token is described in [section 12.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshingAccessToken) of **[OIDC]**.

### Refresh Token
Refresh Tokens MUST be supported by Data Holders.  The usage of Refresh Tokens is specified in [section 12](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokens) of **[OIDC]**.
A Refresh Token MUST expire `n` days after it is issued where `n` is determined by **[CDR]** rules.

## Scopes and Claims
Industry-specific scopes (for example, `bank_account`) will not be referenced in
this profile.

### OIDC Scopes
The following scopes MUST be supported:

- `openid`: As described as [section 3.1.2.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) of **[OIDC]**, this scope MUST be present on each authentication request.
- `profile`: Data Holders MUST support the `profile` scope as described in [section 5.4](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) of **[OIDC]**.  This scope MAY be present on an authentication request.
    - name claim
    - family_name claim
    - given_name claim

### Claims
The following [normal](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NormalClaims) **[OIDC]** claims MUST be supported. This list includes, but is not limited to, **[OIDC]** [standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) :

- `sub`: [Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)](#identifiers) for the End-User at the Data Holder.
- `acr`: Authentication Context Class Reference.  MUST contain a valid [ordinal LoA value](#ordinal-loa).
- `auth_time`: Time when the End-User authentication occurred. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC `auth_time`.
- `name`: End-User's full name in displayable form including all name parts.
- `given_name`: Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User.
- `family_name`: Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User.
- `updated_at`: Time the End-User's information was last updated. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC `updated_at` time.

The following **[VOT]** claims MAY be supported:

-  `vot`: MUST contain a valid [VoT value](#vector-loas).
-  `vtm`: The **[VOT]** trustmark URI.

<a id="identifiers"></a>
## Identifiers and Subject Types
The identifier for an authenticated end-user (subject) MUST be passed in the `sub` claim of an [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-cocnnect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) and [UserInfo response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoResponse) as defined by **[OIDC]**. The
Data Holder MUST generate the `sub` value as a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)
as described in [section 8](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of **[OIDC]**. Furthermore, the identifier SHOULD also be unique relative to the scenario in which the end-user has authenticated. For example, the identifier generated for the same person when they are using a business account SHOULD be different to the identifier that is generated when that same individual is authorising as an individual.

It is RECOMMENDED that the `sub` value is generated as a universally unique
Identifier (UUID) **[RFC4122]**.

<a id="levels-of-assurance-loas"></a>
## Levels of Assurance (LoAs)
Levels Of Assurance (LoAs), returned after a successful authentication, MAY be represented in 2 different forms:

- [Single Ordinal](#ordinal-loa): A single LoA value is represented.
  - Data Holder's MUST support this mechanism.
- [Vector](#vector-loas): One or more LoAs, represented by a vector value, are represented.
  - Data Holder's MAY support this mechanism.

<a id="ordinal-loa"></a>
### Single Ordinal
A Single LoA value is carried in the `acr` claim which is described in [section 2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) of **[OIDC]**.

  - An LoA of 2 is represented by the URI: `urn:cds.au:cdr:2`
    - The authenticator used to attain this level MUST conform with the Credential Level `CL1` rules specified under the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity/join-identity-federation/accreditation-and-onboarding/trusted-digital-identity-framework
) **[TDIF]** Authentication Credential Requirements specification.


  - An LoA of 3 is represented by the URI: `urn:cds.au:cdr:3`
    - The authenticators used to attain this level MUST conform with the Credential Level `CL2` rules specified under the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity/join-identity-federation/accreditation-and-onboarding/trusted-digital-identity-framework
) **[TDIF]** Authentication Credential Requirements specification.

*READ* operations SHALL only be allowed where __at least__ an LoA of 2 has been achieved.

*WRITE* operations SHALL only be allowed where __at least__ an LoA of 3 has been achieved.

<a id="vector-loas"></a>
### Vector

### Overview
This profile incorporates support for [Vectors of Trust](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-vectors-of-trust-15) **[VOT]**. A Vector, in this context, allows for the representation of multiple orthogonal components dimensions that may, but are not limited to, carry information relating to:

- Identity Proofing
- Primary Credential Usage
- Primary Credential Management
- Assertion/Federation Presentation

It is anticipated that due to their characteristics, which include composability, extensibility, and expressiveness, VoTs will be become the relevant standard for assurance representation at Identity Providers. Furthermore, as the **[CDR]** matures and incorporates requirements for Identity Proofing, Credential Management, and Assertion Presentation, these independent LoAs will be progressively added to the VoT **[CDR]** ecosystem. However, the dynamic capabilities of **[VOT]** will ensure that their addition does not break existing **[CDR]** implementations.

<a id="vot-values"></a>
### VoT Values

The following VoT values SHALL be supported to represent authentication assurance levels when employing **[VOT]**.  These are carried in the `vot` claim of an ID Token:

- `CL1`: This is Credential Level CL1 [defined](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity/join-identity-federation/accreditation-and-onboarding/trusted-digital-identity-framework) by the **[TDIF]** Authentication Credential Requirements specification.

- `CL2`: This is Credential Level CL2 [defined](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity/join-identity-federation/accreditation-and-onboarding/trusted-digital-identity-framework) by the **[TDIF]** Authentication Credential Requirements specification.

*READ* operations SHALL only be allowed where __at least__ a `CL1` has been provided.

*WRITE* operations SHALL only be allowed where __at least__ a `CL2` has been provided.

<aside class="information">
The Trustmark URI is yet to be defined.
</aside>

## Transaction Security
### Ciphers
All HTTP calls MUST be made using HTTPS incorporating TLS >= 1.2. Only the following cipher suites SHALL be permitted in accordance with [section 8.5](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#tls-considerations) of **[FAPI-RW]**:

-   TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
-   TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
-   TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
-   TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384

<a id="mutual-tls"></a>
### Mutual TLS

<aside class="information">
Additional content will be added to this section when the Registry requirements are established. For example, verification/revocation of transport certificates.
</aside>

All back-channel communication between Data Recipient and Data Holder systems MUST incorporate, unless stated otherwise, MTLS as part of the TLS handshake:

- The presented Client transport certificate MUST be issued by the CDR Certificate Authority (CA).  The Server MUST NOT trust Client transport certificates issued by other authorities.
- The presented Server transport certificate MUST be issued by the CDR Certificate Authority (CA).  The Client MUST NOT trust Server transport certificates issued by other authorities.

### Holder of Key Mechanism

MTLS MUST be supported as a Holder of Key (HoK) Mechanism.

OAUTB SHALL NOT be supported due to a lack industry support.

MTLS HoK allows issued tokens to be bound to a client certificate as specified in [section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-07.html#SenderConstrainedAccess) of **[MTLS]**.

      },
      "given_name": null,
      "family_name": null
    }
  }
}
```

The Request Object is a signed and encoded JWT specified in [section 6.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RequestObject) of **[OIDC]**.  As per **[FAPI-RW]** [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#authorization-server) and **[FAPI-CIBA]** [section 5.2.2](https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/Financial_API_WD_CIBA.md?fileviewer=file-view-default#markdown-header-522-authorization-server), the `request` parameter MUST be present on requests to both the **[OIDC]** Hybrid Authorisation Endpoint and **[FAPI-CIBA]** Backchannel Authorisation Endpoint. The Request Object enables **[OIDC]** requests to be passed in a single and self-contained parameter.

Request Objects MUST be signed by Data Recipients as specified in [section 8.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#jws-algorithm-considerations) of **[FAPI-RW]**.

Data Recipients MUST include a `cdr_consent_id` value in the Request Object.  A high-level overview of consent is provided in the [section 14](#consent) of this artifact.

Data Holder Authorisation Servers MUST treat a Request Object that does not contain a `cdr_consent_id` as an essential claim as invalid.

Request Object references SHALL NOT be supported.

The `iss` claim SHALL NOT be supported as it duplicates the role of the `client_id` claim.

      "given_name": null,
      "family_name": null
    }

}
```

If a Data Holder supports Vectors of Trust **[VOT]**, they MUST accept Request objects which MAY contain:

- A `vtr` value.
  - Allowed Values are specified in the [VoT values section](#vot-values) of this artifact.
  - This value MUST contain a space-separated string that specifies the `vot` values that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of preference. The VoT satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the `vot` Claim Value.
  - The `vot` Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter.
  - The `vtr` takes precedence over `acr_values`
- A `vot` essential claim.
	- This is the VoT equivalent of an `acr` essential claim.
	- If the `vot` Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID Token with a values parameter requesting specific VoT values, the Data Holder Authorization Server MUST return a `vot` Claim Value that matches one of the requested values. The Data Holder Authorization Server MAY ask the End-User to re-authenticate with additional factors to meet this requirement. If this requirement cannot be met, then the Data Holder Authorization Server MUST treat that outcome as a failed authentication.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

For *WRITE* operations, a Data Recipient:

- SHALL, where a Data Holder supports **[VOT]**, request user authentication with a Credential Level of 2 (`CL2`) or greater by requesting the `vot` claim as an essential claim.

#### Request

To register as a new Client at a Data Holder's Authorisation Server, a Data Recipient MUST `POST` its Client metadata to the Data Holder's Registration Endpoint in the form of an (encoded) signed [JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32) **[JWT]**.  This process is specified in [OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) **[OIDC-CR]**. The registering **[JWT]** is signed by the private key of the Client and MUST include a [software statement](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#page-14).  The software statement is an encoded [JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32) **[JWT]** signed by the CDR Certificate Authority private key and thus supports non-repudiation.  The content of and mechanism for retrieving and generating a software statement is beyond the scope of this profile.

The registering **[JWT]** MUST include, at a minimum, the following fields:

- `iss`: The Data Recipient identifier specified at the Registry.
- `iat`: A JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC issued at time.
- `exp`: A JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC expiry time.
- `aud`: The Data Holder identifier specified at the Registry.
- `jti`: A unique identifier generated by the Data Recipient.
- `redirect_uris`: An Array of Redirection URI values.
- `software_statement`: This is an encoded JWT which includes several claims that describe the Data Recipient application and the Data Recipient organisation.
- `id_token_signed_response_alg`: Token Endpoint preferred signing algorithm.
- `request_object_signing_alg`:  Request Object signing algorithm.
- `token_endpoint_auth_method`: The chosen Client authentication mechanism.

If the Data Holder supports [FAPI-CIBA](https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/Financial_API_WD_CIBA.md?fileviewer=file-view-default) **[FAPI-CIBA]** and the Client wishes to utilise this feature, the registration MUST include the following fields:

- `backchannel_token_delivery_mode`:  This MUST be set to a value of `ping` or `poll`.  `push` mode SHALL NOT be supported.
- `backchannel_authentication_request_signing_alg`: MUST be set to `ES256` or `PS256`.

If the Client supports a delivery mode of `ping`, the registration MUST include the following fields:

- `backchannel_client_notification_endpoint`: This is the endpoint to which the OP will post a notification after a successful or failed end-user authentication.

This request MUST be made with MTLS as specified in [section 11.2](#mutual-tls).

Data Holders MUST ensure that the `CN` (Common Name) in the Client certificate `subject` field matches the `software_id` claim present in the software statement.
Data Holders MUST verify that the embedded software statement has been signed by the CDR Certificate Authority.

#### Response

The Data Holder MUST respond in accordance with [OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) **[OIDC-CR]** sections 3.2 and 3.3.

<a id="consent"></a>
## Consent

<aside class="warning">
How querying, communication, and revocation of consent will be supported technically are a current key area of focus. An approach to consent will be published in January 2019, for the purposes of delivering version 1 of the standards.
</aside>

Prior to initiating an authentication request to a Data Holder's Authorisation Server, a Data Recipient MUST have captured indicative Consumer Consent and passed this to the Data Holder.  A Consent occurrence is assigned a unique `cdr_consent_id` and is referenced by the Data Holder as part of an authorisation process with a Consumer.  This process binds the Consent to the authorisation.  In order to support this functionality, a Data Holder MUST implement and host an API to support the creation of a Consent, the querying of a Consent, and the deletion of a Consent. In this instance the Data Recipient is to be considered the Resource Owner of the Consent occurrence.

The specifics of the Consent API and processing of Consent are beyond the scope of this document.

A Data Holder Token Endpoint MUST:

- Support the `grant type` of `client_credentials` strictly for the purpose of passing an Access Token to a Data Recipient which can be then used to invoke the Consent API.
