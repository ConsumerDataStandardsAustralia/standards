# Additional Standards

Fixed typo in 'Country of registeration' in the Candidate Standards for the Banking and Non-Bank Lending sector
```

The Consumer Data Standards also incorporate other non-binding standards that are developed to facilitate consultation and feedback or to facilitate voluntary extension of CDR implementations.

These standards fall into three categories:

1. `Candidate` standards that are non-binding and stable
2. `Draft` standards that are non-binding but volatile as they are under development
3. `Experimental` standards that are transient and created to test concepts

## Candidate Standards

The Consumer Data Standards currently include the following Candidate Standards:

- [Candidate Standards for the Telecommunications sector](./includes/additional/candidates/telco.html)
- [Candidate Standards for Banking Decision Proposal 306](./includes/additional/candidates/dp306/banking-dp306.html)
- [Candidate Standards for the Banking and Non-Bank Lending sector](./includes/additional/candidates/non-bank-lending/banking-non-bank-lending.html)

## Draft Standards

The Consumer Data Standards do not currently include any Draft Standards.

## Experimental Standards

The experimental standards developed by the Data Standards Body are developed in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-experimental) and are [published here](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards-experimental/).
