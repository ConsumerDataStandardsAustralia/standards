# Authorisation Scopes

The following authorisation scopes have been defined for the standards.  Each API end point will specify which scopes are required to access the data available via that end point.

## Public

Scope Name | Scope ID |Description
-----------|----------|-----------
**Public** | NA | Openly accessible information.  A customer would never need to grant this scope.  This scope is included so that end points that can be called without requiring authorisation can be identified.<br/><br/>Includes access to openly available information such as generic product information.

## OpenID Connect End-User Data
These scopes are used to access [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) scopes and individually requested claims of the authenticated End-User.
