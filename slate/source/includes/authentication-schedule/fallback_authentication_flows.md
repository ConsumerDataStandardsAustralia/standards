## Fallback Authentication Flows

Where Redirect to App is unable to be used for the purposes of CDR authentication, and Decoupled Authentication is not supported, data holders **MUST** continue to support the 'Redirect to Web with OTP' flow in accordance with the relevant [consumer experience authentication](#consumer-experience_authentication-standards) and [security profile](#security-profile) standards.
