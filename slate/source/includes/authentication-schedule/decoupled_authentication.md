## Decoupled Authentication

Where Redirect to App is unable to be used for the purposes of CDR authentication:

- Data recipients **MAY** provide decoupled consent experiences that facilitate separation of the Consumption Device from the authorisation flow.
- Data holders **MAY** provide decoupled authorisation experiences that facilitate separation of the Consumption Device from the Authentication Device. 

If implemented, data holders and data recipients **MUST** support decoupled authentication in accordance with any relevant [consumer experience authentication](#consumer-experience_authentication-standards) and [security profile](#security-profile) standards.
