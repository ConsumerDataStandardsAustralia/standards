These standards have been developed as part of the Australian Government's introduction of the [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right "ACCC Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right (CDR) is intended to be applied sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors.  These standards have been developed to facilitate the Consumer Data Right by acting as a specific baseline for implementation.

These standards are maintained by the [Data Standards Body](https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/treasury/data-standards-body) (DSB) within [**Treasury**](#iref-Treasury), with the Data Standards Chair as the independent decision maker. The work of standards development is conducted in consultation with the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0) ([**ACCC**](#iref-ACCC)) and [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/about-the-consumer-data-right/)) ([**OAIC**](#iref-OAIC))] as co-regulators of the Consumer Data Right ([**CDR**](#iref-CDR)).

The standards are required to be published. The obligations on CDR participants to apply the published standards commence on the commencement of the Consumer Data Right rules:

- where the rules require compliance with the standards, non-compliance with the standards may constitute a breach of the rules.
- where the standards are specified as binding standards as required by the Consumer Data Right rules for the purposes of s56FA of the legislation, they apply as under contract between a data holder and an accredited data recipient.  The legal effect of binding standards as between data holders and accredited data recipients is fully set out in s56FD and s56FE of the legislation.
