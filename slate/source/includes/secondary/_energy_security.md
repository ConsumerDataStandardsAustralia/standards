## Energy

For the energy sector requests for the following data clusters are Secondary Responsibility Requests for which the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is the single designated data holder:
* NMI Standard Data
* Energy Usage
* Distributed Energy Resources

CDR requests for these data clusters to a Data Holder MUST be fulfilled by a request to AEMO.

### Security Profile

In its function as market operator of the National Energy Market, AEMO already maintains a
registration process for industry participants and shares data with participants using real time,
RESTful APIs. This is done via the platform known as the e-Hub.

These processes currently include support processes for registration, maintenance of certificates,
and the management of change. Documentation includes a developer portal, API documentation
and a security profile. More information is published by AEMO.

The e-Hub platform and associated mechanisms (**[EHUB]**) will be considered a normative standard for the requesting of data from AEMO to fulfil Secondary Responsibility Requests.
