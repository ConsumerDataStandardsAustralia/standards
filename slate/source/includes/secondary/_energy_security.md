## Energy

For the energy sector requests for the following data clusters are Shared Responsibility Data Requests for which the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is the single designated secondary data holder:

* NMI Standard Data
* Energy Usage
* Distributed Energy Resources

CDR requests for these data clusters to a Data Holder MUST be fulfilled by a request to AEMO.

### Security Profile

In its function as market operator of the National Energy Market, AEMO already maintains a
registration process for industry participants and shares data with participants using real time,
RESTful APIs. This is done via the platform known as the e-Hub.

These processes currently include support processes for registration, maintenance of certificates,
and the management of change. Documentation includes a developer portal, API documentation
and a security profile. More information is published by AEMO.


The e-Hub platform and associated mechanisms (**[EHUB]**) will be considered a normative standard for the requesting of data from AEMO to fulfil Shared Responsibility Data Requests.
