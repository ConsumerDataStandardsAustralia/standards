## Performance Requirements

API end point performance will be measured in response time of individual API requests from receipt of request to delivery of response.

It is understood that different response times can be measured depending on which technical layer of an API implementation stack is instrumented and that not all of the technical layers between the Data Recipient Software Product and the Data Holder will be in the control of the Data Holder.  As this is implementation specific it is expected that the Data Holder will ensure that the measurement of response time occurs as close to the Data Recipient Software Product as practicable.

In light of these considerations, the performance requirement for Data Holders is:

**95% of calls per hour responded to within a nominated threshold**

The nominated threshold for each end point will be according to the following table:

```delta
Corrected the requirement for the Large Payload tier to remove reference to unattended calls
```

|Tier|Response Time|Applies Toâ€¦|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|Unauthenticated|**1500ms**|All Unauthenticated end points not otherwise specified in a separate threshold.|

|Secondary Request|**1000ms** (for data holders)<br/>**1500ms** (for secondary data holders)|Customer Present calls to the following end points:<ul>*Energy*<li>Get Service Points</li><li>Get Service Point Detail</li><li>Get DER For Service Point</li></ul>|
|Large Secondary Request|**1500ms** (for data holders)<br/>**4500ms** (for secondary data holders)|Unattended calls to the following end points:<ul>*Energy*<li>Get Service Points</li><li>Get Service Point Detail</li><li>Get DER For Service Point</li></ul>All calls to the following end points:<ul>*Energy*<li>Get Bulk Usage</li><li>Get Usage For Service Point</li><li>Get Usage For Specific Service Points</li><li>Get Bulk DER</li><li>Get DER For Specific Service Points</li></ul>|Customer Present calls to the following end points:<ul>*Energy*<li>Get Service Points</li><li>Get Service Point Detail</li><li>Get DER For Service Point</li></ul>|

Note that calls initiated in excess of a traffic threshold (see next section) may be excluded from the performance requirement.
