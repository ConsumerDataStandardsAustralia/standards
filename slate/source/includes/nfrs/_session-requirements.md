## Session Requirements
```diff
Corrected following typo:
Replaced:
- A expiry time of a unique...
with:
+ The expiry time of a unique...
```
The expiry time of a unique session should be set according to the statements included in the [Security Profile](#security-profile).

After a unique session is expired it is expected that the Data Recipient Software Product, for the same customer, may establish a new session as long as the authorisation is still valid.
