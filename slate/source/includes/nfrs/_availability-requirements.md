## Availability Requirements
Service availability requirement for data holders and secondary data holders: *99.5% per month*.

The definition of a period of unavailability is any period of time when any of the API endpoints defined in the standard is unable to reliably provide a successful response to an appropriately constructed request.

The availability requirement applies to both authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints.

The availability requirement does not include planned outages. Planned outages should be:

- Commensurate in length and frequency to other primary digital channels offered by the data holder,
- Published to Data Recipient Software Products with at least one week lead time for normal outages,
- May occur without notification if the change is to resolve a critical service or security issue.


The unavailability of a secondary data holder will mean that some requests cannot be fulfilled by a data holder making a Shared Responsibility Data Request. This will not be taken to mean that the data holder is unavailable.
