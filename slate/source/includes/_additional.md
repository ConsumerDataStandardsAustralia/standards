# Additional Standards

The Consumer Data Standards also incorporate other non-binding standards that are developed to facilitate consultation and feedback or to facilitate voluntary extension of CDR implementations.

These standards fall into three categories:

1. **Candidate** standards that are non-binding and stable.
2. **Draft** standards that are non-binding but volatile as they are under development.
3. **Experimental** standards that are transient and created to test concepts.

## Candidate Standards
