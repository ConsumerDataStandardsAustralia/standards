# Additional Standards

The CDR Data Standards also incorporate other non-binding standards that are developed to facilitate consultation and feedback or to facilitate voluntary extension of CDR implementations.

These standards fall into three categories:

1. **Candidate** standards that are non-binding and stable.
2. **Draft** standards that are non-binding but volatile as they are under development.
3. **Experimental** standards that are transient and created to test concepts.

## Candidate Standards

```diff
Applied non-breaking Banking API changes to the Non-Banking Lending Candidate to maintain alignment.
```

The CDR Data Standards currently include the following Candidate Standards:

- [Candidate Standards for the Telecommunications sector](./includes/additional/candidates/telco/telco.html).
- [Candidate Standards for the Banking and Non-Bank Lending sector](./includes/additional/candidates/non-bank-lending/banking-non-bank-lending.html).

## Draft Standards

The CDR Data Standards do not currently include any Draft Standards.

## Experimental Standards

The experimental standards developed by the Data Standards Body are developed in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-experimental) and are [published here](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards-experimental/).
