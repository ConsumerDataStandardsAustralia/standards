```diff
Changed to a non-breaking space between the indent chevron and property name in all schema Properties tables to prevent line wrapping

Resolved documentation rendering bug causing incorrect indent level to be displayed for some properties

Added statement to clarify that aggregate performance metrics exclude Secondary Data Holder performance

Corrected the requirement for the authorisations property of Get Metrics v4 and v5 to be mandatory
