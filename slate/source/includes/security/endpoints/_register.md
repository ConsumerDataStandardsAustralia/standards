### Participant Endpoints

> OIDC Discovery Configuration Endpoint

```
<InfoSecBaseUri>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```diff
Added clarifying statements for endpoints specified as MTLS and TLS

Added Transaction Security column and clarified descriptions
```

Participants will be required to register base URIs against each of their brands to facilitate the implementation of the Consumer Data Standards

Endpoints specified as MTLS **MUST** be configured according to the [Certificate Trust Model](#certificate-trust-model) in the [Certificate Management](#certificate-management) section.  
Endpoints specified as TLS **MUST** be configured with a certificate issued by a public CA accepted by major web browsers.

This should encompass all endpoints not requiring authentication.<br>Data Holders designated for the Energy sector are not required to expose energy product reference endpoints via their public base URI and are not required, but **MAY**, provide a redirect to the product reference endpoints hosted by the designated data holder. |
