### Register Endpoints

The CDR Register exposes an OIDC Configuration Endpoint with associated JWKS and token endpoints to facilitate issuance of access tokens to consume the protected Register APIs.

### Participant Endpoints

> OIDC Discovery Configuration Endpoint

```
<InfoSecBaseUri>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```



Participants will be required to register base URIs against each of their brands to facilitate the implementation of the CDR Data Standards.

Endpoints specified as MTLS **MUST** be configured according to the [Certificate Trust Model](#certificate-trust-model) in the [Certificate Management](#certificate-management) section.  
Endpoints specified as TLS **MUST** be configured with a certificate issued by a public CA accepted by major web browsers.

| Base URI | DH&nbsp;Brand | ADR&nbsp;Brand | Transaction Security | Description
|-----------|:------:|:------:|----------------------|-----------------|
|**PublicBaseUri**|	<i class="icon-check"></i> | | TLS | Base URI for the Consumer Data Standard public endpoints. This should encompass all endpoints not requiring authentication.<br>Data Holders designated for the Energy sector are not required to expose energy product reference endpoints via their public base URI and are not required, but **MAY**, provide a redirect to the product reference endpoints hosted by the designated data holder. |
|**ResourceBaseUri**|	<i class="icon-check"></i> | | MTLS | Base URI for the Consumer Data Standard resource endpoints. This **MUST** encompass all CDS resource endpoints requiring authentication. |
|**InfoSecBaseUri**|	<i class="icon-check"></i> | | TLS | Base URI for the [OIDC Discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) only.<br>Endpoints specified in the Discovery endpoint have the requirements detailed in the [Security Endpoints](#security-endpoints) section. |
|**AdminBaseUri**|	<i class="icon-check"></i> | | MTLS | Base URI for the Consumer Data Standard admin endpoints called by the CDR Register. |
|**ExtensionBaseUri**|	<i class="icon-check"></i> | | TLS/MTLS | Base URI for the Data Holder extension endpoints to the Consumer Data Standard (optional).<ul><li>TLS: for public endpoints.<li>MTLS: for authenticated endpoints.</ul> |
|**RevocationUri**|	| <i class="icon-check"></i> | TLS | Used for consent withdrawal notification from a Data Holder and is populated in the [SSA](#dynamic-client-registration). |
|**RecipientBaseUri**|	| <i class="icon-check"></i> | TLS | Base URI for the Consumer Data Standard Data Recipient Software Product endpoints. <br>This **MUST** be the base to provide reference to [Data Recipient Endpoints](#cdr-register-api_get-data-recipients). |
