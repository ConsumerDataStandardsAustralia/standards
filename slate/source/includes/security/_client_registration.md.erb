## Client Registration

### Dynamic Client Registration
Data Recipients register with Data Holders according to **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)** to obtain client credentials used to retrieve consumer data on behalf of a consumer.

#### Software Statement Assertion (SSA)

As per **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)**, a Software Statement is defined in as: _A digitally signed JSON Web Token (JWT) created in accordance with **[[JWT]](#nref-JWT)** that asserts metadata values about the client software_
> An SSA is a digitally signed JSON Web Token (JWT) created in accordance with **[[JWT]](#nref-JWT)** that asserts metadata values about the client software.

Such that:

* The CDR Register **MUST** issue Software Statements to **active** Data Recipients for **active** Software Products
* The CDR Register **MUST** issue distinct Software Statements for each `Software Product ID`
* Software Statements are issued with a **10 minute** expiry time
* As per **[[FAPI-RW-Draft]](#nref-FAPI-RW-Draft)**, SSAs are signed by the CDR Register using **PS256**
* CDR Register public keys are exposed on a dedicated JWKS URI endpoint
* The CDR Register [JWKS endpoint](#get-jwks) is an unauthenticated endpoint, using TLS
* Data Recipients **MUST** present a valid SSA when undertaking dynamic client registration
* Data Holders **MUST NOT** register Data Recipient software products unless they present a verified [Registration Request](#registration-request-using-jwt) with a verified [SSA](#ssa-definition)

Refer to the [Register APIs](#register-apis) section for the endpoint definitions that will be used to retrieve and validate SSAs.

#### SSA Definition

To register with a Data Holder, the Data Recipient sends an HTTP POST to the Data Holder registration endpoint.

* The request **MUST** be presented in the format of a **[[RFC7519]](#nref-RFC7519)** compliant JWT.
* The request **MUST** use the HTTP POST method, using the `application/jwt` content type.
* The JWT **MUST** be signed using algorithms specified in [section 8.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#jws-algorithm-considerations) of **[[FAPI-RW-Draft]](#nref-FAPI-RW-Draft)**

The client registration request **MUST** contain the following claims in the JWT payload unless designated as Optional:

| Claim | Required | Description
|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|**iss**|	Required | Contains the identifier for the Data Recipient Software Product (SoftwareProductId) as defined in the CDR Register
|**iat**|	Required | The time at which the request was issued by the Data Recipient  expressed as seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC
|**exp**|	Required | The time at which the request expires expressed as seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC
|**jti**|	Required | Unique identifier for the JWT, used to prevent reuse of the token.
|**aud**|	Required | Contains the DH issuer value as described in the [OIDC Discovery Document](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#end-points)
|**redirect_uris**|	Optional | Array of redirection URI strings for use in redirect-based flows. If used, redirect_uris **MUST** match or be a subset of the redirect_uris as defined in the SSA
|**token_endpoint_auth_method**| Required | The requested authentication method for the token endpoint. The only supported method will be **private_key_jwt**
|**token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg**| Required | The algorithm used for signing the JWT
|**grant_types**|	Required | Array of OAuth 2.0 grant type strings that the client can use at the token endpoint. Supported values: **[client_credentials, authorization_code, refresh_token]**
|**response_types**|	Required | Array of the OAuth 2.0 response type strings that the client can use at the authorization endpoint. **value: [code id_token]**
|**application_type**|	Optional | Kind of the application. The only supported application type will be **web**
|**id_token_signed_response_alg**| Required | Algorithm with which an id_token is to be signed</br></br>Supported values as constrained by **[[FAPI-RW-Draft]](#nref-FAPI-RW-Draft)**

|**id_token_encrypted_response_enc**|	A256GCM</br>A128CBC-HS256


### Registration Validation

Validation and use of the JWT and the claims described above **MUST** be performed in accordance with **[[JWT]](#nref-JWT)**.

SSA JWT signatures **MUST** be verified against the associated JWK published at the CDR Register [JWKS endpoint](#get-jwks).

The registration request JWT **MUST** be verified against the associated JWK published by the Data Recipient. Data Holders are required to verify the request JWT signature against an associated JWK from the `jwks_uri` extracted from the SSA.

Data Holders **MUST NOT** allow multiple active registrations for the same `software_id`.

**From 31st August 2022**, Data Holders **MUST** ignore unsupported authorisation scopes presented in the SSA for the creation and update of client registrations.

Data Holders **MUST** adhere to the [NFR performance requirements](#performance-requirements) when validating and responding to registration requests. Additional validation processes (such as outbound white-listing of data recipient endpoints) **MUST NOT** prevent specified response times being met.

On successful registration, the response **MUST** be returned to the  Data Recipient conforming to [Section 3.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-3.2.1) of **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)**.

| Claim | Required | Description
|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|**client_id**|	Required | Contains the dynamically generated identifier for the Software Product issued by the Data Holder
|**client_id_issued_at**|	Optional | Time at which the client identifier was issued

As per [Section 3.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-3.2.1) of **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)**, additionally, the authorisation server **MUST** return all registered metadata about this client, including any fields provisioned by the authorisation server itself.

The Software Statement value **MUST** be returned unmodified. Client metadata elements used from the software statement **MUST** also be returned directly as top-level client metadata values in the registration response.

Any additional claims **MUST** be ignored and not returned on completion of the request.


### Registration Errors

>
Example Error Response

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
 "error": "invalid_software_statement",
 "error_description": "Duplicate registrations for a given software_id are not valid"
}
```

When an error condition occurs during a registration request, the response **MUST** be returned to the Accredited Data Recipient conforming to [Section 3.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-3.2.2) of **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)**.

Duplicate registrations are not permitted so attempts to create a registration which already exists **MUST** return an HTTP 400 error.

Registration error responses schemas are defined in the [DCR APIs](#dcr-apis) section.

For those Registration errors which do not map to [Section 3.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-3.2.2) of **[[DCR]](#nref-DCR)**, [HTTP Response Codes](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#http-response-codes) in the Consumer Data Standards **SHOULD** be used.

Data Holders **MUST** expose Client Registration Management endpoints as defined in the [DCR APIs](#dcr-apis)

| HTTP Verb |  | MTLS | HoK | Client Authentication
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|**POST /register**|	Required | <i class="icon-check"></i> |  | N/A
|**GET /register/{clientID}**|	Required | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> | Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope
|**PUT /register/{clientID}**|	Required | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> | Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope
|**DELETE /register/{clientID}**|	Optional | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> | Client Credentials with cdr:registration scope

* Registration endpoints will be exposed in the OIDC Discovery Configuration Endpoint
* POST and PUT operations **MUST** accept the SSA payload.
* Fields data holders do not support are not persisted.
* Access tokens issued for consuming CDR Data **SHOULD NOT** be used for client registration maintenance and vice-versa


### PUT Operations
Registrations **MUST** only be updated via Registration PUT operations

PUT operations are to be used for one of two scenarios:

1. The client has updated their registration details on the CDR Register and updates this information to the data holder
2. A new version of the SSA has been released and the client updates this information to the data holder
