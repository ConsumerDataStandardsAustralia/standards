## Identifiers and Subject Types  
### sub claim
The identifier for an authenticated end-user (subject) **MUST** be passed in the `sub` claim of an [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) and [UserInfo response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoResponse) as defined by **[[OIDC]](#nref-OIDC)**.

The Data Holder **MUST** generate the `sub` value as a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as described in [section 8](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of **[[OIDC]](#nref-OIDC)**. Furthermore, the identifier **MUST** be unique per customer as per the definition of customer in the CDR Federation section of this profile.

The Data Holder **MUST** support the `sector_identifier_uri` in PPID generation according to **[[OIDC]](#nref-OIDC)** if this field was supplied by the client during registration.

It is RECOMMENDED that the `sub` value is generated as a version 4 Universally Unique
Identifier (UUID) **[[RFC4122]](#nref-RFC4122)**.

The CDR Arrangement ID is a unique string representing a consent arrangement between a Data Recipient Software Product and Data Holder for a given consumer.

The identifier **MUST** be unique per customer according to the definition of customer in the CDR Federation section of this profile.

The Data Holder **MUST** provide the CDR Arrangement ID as the claim ``cdr_arrangement_id`` in the Token End Point response and Token Introspection End Point response.

A Data Holder **MUST** only return the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` in the Token and Token Introspection End Point responses if they also support concurrent consent. This ensures that Data Recipient Software Products have a reliable way to determine whether a given Data Holder supports concurrent consent.

Statements related to the CDR Arrangement ID:

* The CDR Arrangement ID **MUST** be unique to a Data Holder
* The CDR Arrangement ID **MUST** be non-guessable and **MUST NOT** identify a consumer
* A CDR Arrangement ID **SHOULD** be generated using an algorithm that reduces the chances of collision
* A CDR Arrangement ID **MUST** be static across consents within the one sharing arrangement (e.g. across consent renewal and re-authorisation)

#### Obtaining a CDR Arrangement ID

For any existing consents, Data Holders **MUST** retrospectively generate a ``cdr_arrangement_id`` such that Data Recipient Software Products can obtain a valid ``cdr_arrangement_id`` for all active consents they hold.

A Data Recipient Software Product can call either the Token or Token Introspection End Points at any point post-consent to obtain the CDR Arrangement ID in the response JSON as the claim ``cdr_arrangement_id``.
