The Request Object is a signed and encoded JWT specified in [section 6.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RequestObject) of **[OIDC]**. As per **[[FAPI-1.0-Advanced]](#nref-FAPI-1-0-Advanced)** [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html#authorization-server), the _request_ parameter **MUST** be present on requests to the **[OIDC]** Hybrid Authorisation endpoint. The Request Object enables **[OIDC]** requests to be passed in a single and self-contained parameter.

Request Objects **MUST** be signed by Data Recipient Software Products as specified in [section 8.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html#algorithm-considerations) of **[[FAPI-1.0-Advanced]](#nref-FAPI-1-0-Advanced)**.

Request Object references **MUST** be supported if the Data Holder supports Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR).

### Requesting Sharing Duration
To facilitate the specification of the duration for consent to share CDR data that is approved by the consumer, a mechanism for the Data Recipient Software Product to specify a sharing duration to the Data Holder is required.

To accomplish this, the Data Holder **MUST** support an additional claim in the authorisation request object named _sharing_duration_. The _sharing_duration_ claim **MUST** be handled as follows:

- The _sharing_duration_ parameter is a number.
- The value of the _sharing_duration_ parameter will contain the requested duration for sharing, in seconds.
- If the _sharing_duration_ value exceeds one year then a duration of one year will be assumed.
-	If the _sharing_duration_ value is less than or equal to 24 hours, then one-time collection will be assumed, and a Refresh Token **SHOULD** be provided by the Data Holder.
- If the _sharing_duration_ value is zero or absent then once off access will be assumed and only an Access Token (without a Refresh Token) will be provided on successful authorisation.
-	If a Refresh Token is issued for one-time collection the Data Recipient Software Product **MUST** call the Data Holderâ€™s revocation endpoint after successful collection of the CDR data.
- If the _sharing_duration_ value is negative then the authorisation **SHOULD** fail.

Note that the period of "one year" in the above statements **SHOULD** be interpreted as 365, 24 hour days (or 31,536,000 seconds).

The Data Recipient Software Product is able to obtain the expiration of the sharing arrangement by presenting a refresh token to the token introspection endpoint. The expiration value is provided in the _exp_ field in the response.


### Specifying an existing arrangement

To facilitate the amending of an existing arrangement, the following statements apply:

* Data Holders **MUST** support the cdr_arrangement_id_ claim provided in the Request Object.
* The Data Recipient Software Product **MUST** provide the _cdr_arrangement_id_ claim in the Request Object if requesting to amend a current authorisation in accordance with [Consent: Amendment of Collection Consents and Authorisations](#consumer-experience_consent-standards).
* Data Holders **MUST** treat the request under the [Amending Authorisation Standards](#amending-authorisation-standards) if the _cdr_arrangement_id_ claim is provided.

If a Data Recipient Software Product provides the _cdr_arrangement_id_ claim in the request object to the Data Holder's [PAR endpoint](#pushed-authorisation-endpoint), the Data Holder **MUST** revoke any existing tokens related to the arrangement once the new consent is successfully established and a new set of tokens has been provided to the Data Recipient Software Product.


### Request Object Submission

In addition:

* Request Object references **SHALL NOT** be supported in any mode of use other than **[[PAR]](#nref-PAR)**. If a Data Holder does not support **[[PAR]](#nref-PAR)**, it **MUST NOT** support Request Object references.
*	The Request URI is intended to be a single-use reference to the respective request object.
* The Request URI **MUST** expire between 10 seconds and 90 seconds.
* Data Recipient Software Products **MAY** provide an existing _cdr_arrangement_id_ claim in an authorisation request object to establish a new consent under an existing arrangement.
* Data Holders **MUST** revoke existing refresh tokens and access tokens when a _cdr_arrangement_id_ is provided in the Request Object but only after successful authorisation.
* If the _cdr_arrangement_id_ is not related to the consumer being authenticated it **MUST** be rejected.
* If the _cdr_arrangement_id_ is not recognised by to the Data Holder it **MUST** be rejected.

<h4 id="security-profile_request-object_data-holders">Data Holders</h4>

Data Holders **MUST** support Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR) via the pushed authorisation endpoint according to **[[PAR]](#nref-PAR)**.



* Data Holders **MUST** support **[[RFC9126]](#nref-RFC9126)** (PAR) using **[[PKCE]](#nref-PKCE)** (**[[RFC7636]](#nref-RFC7636)**) with S256 as the code challenge method in accordance with **[[FAPI-1.0-Advanced]](#nref-FAPI-1-0-Advanced)** [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html#authorization-server).
*	Data Holders **MUST** require PAR for authorisation request data in accordance with **[[RFC9126]](#nref-RFC9126)** where _require_pushed_authorization_requests_ parameter is set to `true`.
*	Data Holders **MUST** require the request object to contain an _exp_ claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the _nbf_ claim in accordance with **[[FAPI-1.0-Advanced]](#nref-FAPI-1-0-Advanced)** [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html#authorization-server).
* Authorisation request data **MUST** only be accepted using PAR.
* Data Holders **MUST** reject authorisation requests containing the _request_ parameter.
*	Data Holders **MUST** reject the reuse of _request_uri_ values.

<h4 id="security-profile_request-object_data-recipient-software-products">Data Recipient Software Products</h4>

*	Data Recipient Software Products **MUST** send request objects containing an _nbf_ claim and an _exp_ claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the _nbf_ claim.
* Data Recipient Software Products **MUST** ONLY use a _request_uri_ value once.
* Data Recipients **MUST** ONLY send authorisation request data using **[[RFC9126]](#nref-RFC9126)** (PAR) and use **[[PKCE]](#nref-PKCE)** (**[[RFC7636]](#nref-RFC7636)**) in accordance with **[[FAPI-1.0-Advanced]](#nref-FAPI-1-0-Advanced)**.
*	Data Recipients Software Products **MUST** support **[[PKCE]](#nref-PKCE)** (**[[RFC7636]](#nref-RFC7636)**) and **MUST** use `S256` as the code challenge method.
